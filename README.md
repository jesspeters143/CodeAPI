Star Wars API


This project is a basic webpage displaying items from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/).
​
## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
​
## Optimizations
Eventually, I would like to display all data from API, separating it by characther, movies, planets, all in one page.
​
## Lessons Learned:
I learned about fetching data from an API. Links, and buttons.
​
## Installation Instructions:
